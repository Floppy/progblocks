I have a two-year-old and a seven-year-old with learning difficulties. I want to introduce them to programming ideas, but it's way too early for a lot of things.

ProgBlocks is a modular physical programming system for robots. Imagine a set of building blocks that stick together in a chain, where each block is a command for a robot. Each block in the chain builds up a program that you can run by hitting a button on the start block.

The idea is that the system is robot-agnostic, and could be used to control any robot you like with a software interface (using something like [Artoo](http://artoo.io)).
